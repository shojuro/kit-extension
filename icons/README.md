# Extension Icons

This folder should contain the following icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)  
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

For now, these are placeholder references. You'll need to create or add actual icon files.

## Temporary Icon Generation

You can create simple placeholder icons using any image editor or online tool:
1. Create a square image with "KM" text or brain emoji (ðŸ§ )
2. Export at the three required sizes
3. Name them appropriately and place in this folder

## Icon Requirements
- PNG format
- Transparent background recommended
- Clear at small sizes
- Consistent branding across sizes
